# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing
# for programs that use the GNU Readline library.
# Existing programs include FTP, Bash, & GDB.

# You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r.

# First, include any systemwide bindings & variables from /etc/inputrc
# $include /etc/inputrc

# See http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/Keybindings for many details
# also https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Readline

# Use Unicode & do NOT use the "8bit hack" to input/output non-ASCII characters
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off

# When pressing up or down arrows, show only history entries
# that match what was already typed
"\e[A":history-search-backward
"\e[B":history-search-forward

# Turn on case insensitivity for tab-completion
# type "doc<tab>" to search for "Documents"
set completion-ignore-case on

# Words which have more than one possible completion 
# cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Do not echo ^C after Ctrl+C is pressed
set echo-control-characters off

# Do not insert characters from a completion that match characters
# after the word being completed
# If cursor is after the ‘e’ in ‘Makefile’,
# <tab> will result in ‘Makefile’ rather than ‘Makefilefile’
